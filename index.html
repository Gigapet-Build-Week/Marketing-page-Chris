        old in mind. We have added features for the pet to have different
        states, to be more engaging for children. A User Interface with ease in
        use for parents and their young ones. Let your children watch his/her
        pet grow while learning to eat healthier and logging it.

        -Use the Gigapet app to encourage children to have healthier, balanced
        eating habits - Parents can login in and allow their childrento add the
        food they ate throughout the day, if it was a healthy choice your pet
        becomes happier and can grow, if it a not so healthy choice, your pet
        can get sick. Eating habits and their consequences are hard for anyone
        to grasp, but especially children. Children need feedback to keep them
        engaged and by having a pet that responds directly and visibly to their
        choices we achieve that engagement. - Our mission is to help promote
        Healthier, happier children through engaging feedback.
